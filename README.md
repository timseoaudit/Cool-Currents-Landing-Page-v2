# Cool-Currents-Landing-Page-v2

I created a Website based of our own Shop (coolcurrents.co.uk).
While i stayed with the our Colors I did change anything else.
I focused on building a Website that have a consitent design, with round and golden borders. 
I am quite happy with the overall result, although I could improve the Gallery part to be better responsive as it does have a slight inaccuracy. 
I am extremly satisfied how the Team section turned out thou. 

The Project took me overall about 12h, but I did work the first 4h on a different approach, which did not work at all, so that I deleted my whole code and started at 0. Thats why its v2. 

I would appriciate every constructive feedback.
